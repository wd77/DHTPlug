This is intended for use with a Jeenode and a DHTxx sensor.

Download this and put it in your <arduinosketchbookfolder>.

You will also need the DHT-sensor-library from adafruit:
https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library
Download that also, rename the folder to DHT and put it in
your <arduinosketchbookfolder>/libraries/ folder. You can 
also read the instruction in the readme.txt included in the
DHT-sensor-library. 

You can also read my posts about this beginning with this one:
